# ironVoxel
I developed this Unity voxel game library in 2013 and 2014 and sold it for a couple years to other game developers. It's become outdated now and is no longer for sale, but I figured I'd go ahead and put it out there for anyone that might find some use or inspiration from it. There will be no updates or patches; this is an archived project.
