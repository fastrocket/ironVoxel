# ironVoxel
I developed this Unity voxel game library in 2013 and 2014 and sold it for a couple years to other game developers. It's become outdated now and is no longer for sale, but I figured I'd go ahead and put it out there for anyone that might find some use or inspiration from it. There will be no updates or patches; this is an archived project.

## Features
* Custom voxel renderer, including lighting
* Infinite world generator
* World saving & loading
* Asynchronous in as many key areas as I could
* 100% C#, no DLLs
